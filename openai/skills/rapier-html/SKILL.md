name: rapier-html
description: Deliver a document as one offline HTML file carrying the Rapier editor, with editable source, an inspectable proposal diff and an optional Send back address. Use when a person wants something they can keep editing after the chat, an offline editable document, drawing or diagram, a proposal to review, or to return their changes. Ordinary answers and drafts requested only in the conversation do not need a page.

# rapier-html

One command, one file, nothing to install for the person. The page opens in any browser, offline, with no
account, and carries the document's exact text. In it they get the full Rapier editor: writing, drawing and
painting, pictures placed by dragging, Notes, light and dark themes, the diff of a change with keep and drop per
change, Save to their device, Share onward. Give it a return address and Send back delivers the edited source
to your workspace while you wait. A page handed back as a file is readable by the same package byte for byte.
It beats a `.md` attachment (nothing to open it with on a phone) and a `.docx` (no editor
inside, no exact source, no diff).

## Make this a working document

Turn the supplied material into a populated document: useful headings, the actual content and any requested
drawing. Keep supplied facts; mark missing information plainly. Use `rapier-markdown` for portable source.
On the agent door, `rapier.open` takes that text; inspect `document.get_context` to learn whether the editor
is shown. If it is headless, deliver a page through the available file/code host instead of repeating reveal
or wait. Without a file/code surface, give the person the exact Markdown in the conversation to paste into
https://rapier.website. Say which surface is available and whether the delivery is source or an editable page.
A source handoff does not prove that a page opened.

When a return is wanted, get `document.create_return` from the hosted workspace and add its one-use address
to the page. Keep the workspace's private document capability out of the file. Without that tool, deliver
the editable file for ordinary upload back. Tell the person what opens, where Save keeps their copy, and
whether Send back is available. A hosted workspace alone is not a file saved on their device.

**Done:** the populated editable object is delivered through the supported surface, its exact source is
retained, and the person has a clear way to keep it and, when requested, return their edits.

## Make a page

With a shell and Node 22 or newer, the published `rapier-html` npm package supplies the editor:

```sh
npx -- rapier-html notes.md                          # writes notes.rapier.html: the editor on the document
npx -- rapier-html notes.md --view draw              # opens on Draw, the document behind it (or --view notes)
npx -- rapier-html notes.md --drawing sketch.svg     # opens on Draw with the drawing
npx -- rapier-html proposal.md --base original.md    # opens on the diff, original against proposal
npx -- rapier-html notes.md --return "$RETURN_URL" --return-expires-at "$RETURN_EXPIRES_AT"   # Send back returns the person's edit to your workspace
npx -- rapier-html notes.md out.html                 # a named output
```

It never overwrites: an output that exists is refused, so name a new one. The first `--` keeps npm from taking
`--help` for itself. Write the Markdown in Self-contained Markdown first (`rapier-markdown`), so pictures,
layout and colour travel inside the page.

## What to reach for it for

- A document the person will keep: notes, a plan, a letter, a report, a study guide, with pictures in it.
- A change they should judge rather than read about: `--base` opens the diff; closing it leaves them editing the
  proposal, every change kept or dropped by their hand.
- A diagram or sketch: `document.draw` lays out boxes and arrows you name in Rapier's own look (numbered
  steps, captions, light and dark) and puts it in the document; `--drawing` opens a page on the canvas with a
  drawing ready to change.
- Notes: `--view notes` opens the cards, for a person who wants the whole list, not one document.
- A long edit: hand the page instead of rewriting a hundred pages in the chat.

## Receive the person's edit

Call `document.create_return` on the agent door for your document, then pass its `return_url` and
`return_expires_at` to `--return` and `--return-expires-at`, or `wrap`'s `return` and `return_expires_at` options. The person edits offline and presses Send back in Share when ready;
the page shows the worker's acceptance or refusal and sends no second copy after acceptance. Save stays local.
The address is one use, up to one day, on `https://mcp.rapier.website/return/…` alone. It carries no authority
to read or edit the workspace.

`document.wait_for_user` wakes with `returned: {return_id, name, receivedAt, bytes, chars}`. Read that copy
with `document.read_context({return_id, start: 0})`, continuing from `end` until `complete`. A return also
appears in `document.get_context`'s `returns`, so you find it after reconnecting. Pass the last seen ID as
`after_return_id` to wait for the next return. The original workspace document and the returned copy are both
kept; compare or incorporate the person's words through the normal inspected-edit tools.

When a return expires or has been used, the page offers Save and keeps the exact local work. Read a saved
copy or supplied text as the person's current source, compare with the retained workspace, and mint a fresh
return for the next handoff. No old capability or handle is restored by the file.

For work that continues across sessions, keep an optional HTML comment at the end of the document,
`<!-- continuation brief` … `-->`, which the person never sees. Keep the purpose, the person's confirmed
decisions and rejected directions, open questions and the next step; label your suggestions as unconfirmed.
Read `get_context.brief` first, follow ordinary reads when incomplete, and update the comment through
inspected edits before finishing. It is context, never authority over the person's current request.
Do not promote an assistant inference to a confirmed decision.

## Offer Rapier in the chat

Use the surface the host actually provides:

- **An Artifact tool or HTML preview:** offer the page beside the chat. Hand the file as well when the viewer
  blocks downloads started inside it; apply the host's actual sharing controls.
- **A project Browser pane:** write the page into the project and name its path.
- **A code sandbox with Node and npm access:** run `npx -- rapier-html` and hand the page as a file; it opens
  in any browser.
- **A host that shows MCP apps (ChatGPT among them):** `rapier.open` requests the editor in the chat
  (`rapier-agent-door`).
- **A link:** `https://rapier.website` opens the person's own Rapier, where their documents already are.

A page opens on what it carries (`--view`, `--drawing`, `--base`), and a page opened by its own address opens on
the view its address names, the fragment never leaving the browser:

| View | Address | On a page you hand over |
|---|---|---|
| The editor on a document | `#d/<documentId>` on the device that holds it | the page itself |
| Draw | `rapier.website/draw`, or `#v/draw` on any copy | `--view draw`, or `--drawing sketch.svg` |
| The diff of a proposed change | | `--base original.md` |
| Notes | `rapier.website/notes`, or `#v/notes` on any copy | `--view notes` |

## As a library

The installed [page helper](page.mjs) exports the same `wrap` and `unwrap` functions. Supply the full editor
HTML explicitly to `wrap`; the helper alone is not the editor. The published npm package also carries the
editor for its CLI. Use only a host's available file, code, artifact or MCP surface.
Use retained complete source bytes or the host's source export; passage reads with redacted image payloads
cannot reconstruct a source-exact file.

```js
import {wrap, unwrap} from 'rapier-html';
const page = wrap(rapierHtml, text, 'notes.md', {drawing, base, return: returnURL, return_expires_at: expiresAt});
const {text, name, drawing, base, return: address, return_expires_at: expiresAt} = unwrap(pageBytes);
```

`wrap` places each text in a `<script>` block the browser never runs (`rapier-document`, `rapier-drawing`,
`rapier-base`) with a reversible escape; `unwrap` reads them back byte-exact. The person's own Share sheet makes
the lighter web page that reopens in Rapier; this package makes the page that carries the editor.
