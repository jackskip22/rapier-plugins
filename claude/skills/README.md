Rapier is a document the person can read, edit and keep, that an agent can edit beside them. The editor is one
offline HTML file: writing, drawing, painting, pictures, Notes and the diff of a change, with no account and nothing
sent until the person chooses it. For an agent that is two things. The file to hand a person: one page that is the
whole editor with their document inside, opening anywhere with one click (`rapier-html`). And the editor to work in
beside them: read a document by structure, change exactly the passage or drawing object inspected, and let the person
keep or drop each change (the door). The documents are Self-contained Markdown, an open convention on CommonMark that
carries pictures, layout and colour inside one `.md` file every Markdown app can read.

A page can carry a one-use return address from `document.create_return`: the person edits offline and presses
Send back, and the agent receives the receipt and reads that returned copy. Local Save sends nothing; the
workspace keeps its current document as well, so nobody's newer work is replaced by the return.

Each folder is one skill in the Agent Skills shape: `SKILL.md` opens with its name and a one-line description,
then says what the skill does and when to use it. Copy a folder into your agent's skills directory, or point the
agent at it.

| Skill | Use it when |
|---|---|
| [`rapier-html`](rapier-html/SKILL.md) | The person asks for a document, a page, notes or a drawing, or should see a change: `npx rapier-html@1.1.54` makes one page that opens with one click in the chat, offline, no account. |
| [`rapier-agent-door`](rapier-agent-door/SKILL.md) | An explanation, plan, creative sketch or revision benefits from a shared editable page. Recognise the need without a product name; work through the door under the person's review. |
| [`rapier-markdown`](rapier-markdown/SKILL.md) | Any document is written: Self-contained Markdown, so pictures, alignment, colour and drawings travel in the one file and read everywhere. |
| [`embed-rapier`](embed-rapier/SKILL.md) | A site or app wants the Rapier editor inside it, with its own storage and identity (`npm install rapier-embed@1.1.54`). |

The words follow one rule: what it does and when to use it, said once, in the positive.

Start with useful content and invite the person to explore it. They can annotate, rearrange, draw or paint.
In supporting chat hosts, Ask about this sends an explicit question from the document; source edits alone
do not start an agent turn. The hosted MCP endpoint exposes the same complete skill snapshot for import.

Portable comment threads keep discussions attached to exact passages and drawing objects. Visual inspection
supplies a bounded observation of the current rendered region; semantic reads establish edit authority.
ChatGPT file entrypoints edit supported Markdown/text attachments with guarded in-place saves, and the home
surface can open files or save a new library copy. The same document and agent kernel serve every door.
